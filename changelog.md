# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added
- `Launch-SystemShell.ps1` — Explicit, non-persistent SYSTEM shell launcher for security testing. Uses a temporary scheduled task. No auto-elevation, no silent UAC bypass, no persistence.
- `tests/Test-Suite.ps1` — Comprehensive regression test suite for `God_mode.ps1` and `Launch-SystemShell.ps1`. Validates syntax, script structure, installer/uninstaller logic, and menu integrity without making system changes.
- `changelog.md` — Project changelog initialized.

### Improved
- Project structure reorganized with `tests/` folder for regression scripts.
